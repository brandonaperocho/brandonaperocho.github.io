            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi, I'm Brandon Aperocho! I currently work at Oliver Wyman Vector as a L4 Software Engineer with 5 years of experience. I studied at 
            University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BASc). I majored in Computer Science with an Information Security
            Specialist and a Mathematics Minor.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            With my spare time, I currently enjoy playing games such as Genshin Impact, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Monster Hunter: World 
            and in anticipation of Monster Hunter: Wilds! When I am not playing games, I like to watch the NBA and the League of Legends E-Sports 
            competitive scene. I also enjoy reading and watching videos on new tech to learn about and stay up to date with the fast growing tech world. 
            </p>
            
            <p> 
            With my studies, I have become thoroughly passionate about cyber security, automation, and software development. If you think you have 
            some opportunities that I may be interested in and think I may be a perfect fit, feel free to contact me and download my resumé!
